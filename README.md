# Final Tech Elevator Group Capstone Project 
â€‹
This was my final capstone project at Tech Elevator. My primary responsibility was the frontend and handling the Google APIs. I contributed everywhere beyond my scope. 

I contributed in configuring the SQL Schema, SCRUM methods(JAVA, Javascript), and JSON handling(Java). I was solely responsible for designing the frontend.
